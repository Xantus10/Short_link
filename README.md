# ShortUrl  

Who has never been in need for a short url? Well ShortUrl is a web application made in Flask to do just that.  

## Usage  

Clone this repository, then make sure you have python and Flask installed. If you do, simply run app.py, your app should be availible on localhost port 80.  

## TODO  

Better handle missing protocol. Add support for other protocols.
